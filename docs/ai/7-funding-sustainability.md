# Document 7: Funding/Sustainability Plan

---

## Principles

1. **No advertising** - Advertising creates misaligned incentives (engagement over action)
2. **No VC funding** - VC requires growth-at-all-costs, exit pressure
3. **User data not monetized** - Core to value proposition
4. **Sustainability over scale** - Better to serve 10,000 well than 1,000,000 poorly
5. **Transparency** - Open about costs and funding sources

---

## Recommended Funding Path

### Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Founder-Funded + Grant Applications

**Funding sources:**

- Personal savings/runway
- Begin grant applications

**Monthly need:** ~$50 infrastructure + living costs

**Actions:**

- Apply to NLNet, NGI grants (Solid-aligned)
- Apply to local community foundations
- Set up Open Collective for transparency

**Risk:** Founder runway exhaustion

---

### Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Grants + Early Donations

**Funding sources:**

- Grant funding (if successful)
- Open Collective donations from early users
- Continued personal funding if needed

**Monthly need:** ~$100-300 infrastructure

**Actions:**

- Launch donation page
- Transparent cost reporting
- Apply for larger grants with Phase 1 evidence
- Begin organizational outreach

**Risk:** Grant rejection, low donation uptake

---

### Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Organizational Revenue

**Funding sources:**

- Organizational subscriptions (primary)
- Continued grants
- User donations
- Optional premium features

**Monthly need:** ~$500-1000 infrastructure + possible contractor

**Actions:**

- Develop organizational features
- Sales outreach to community orgs
- Partnership with Transition Towns, climate groups
- Consider crowdfunding for specific features

**Goal:** 10-20 organizational subscribers at $50-100/month = $500-2000/month

**Risk:** Organizations don't see value

---

### Phase 4 (Months 25+): Sustainable Mix

**Funding sources:**

- Organizational subscriptions: 40-50%
- Grants (ongoing): 20-30%
- Donations: 10-20%
- Premium features: 5-10%

**Monthly need:** $2000-5000

**Goal:** Cover infrastructure + part-time community/development support

---

## Break-Even Scenarios

### Scenario A: Donation-Focused

- 5,000 active users
- 2% donate average $5/month
- = $500/month
- Covers infrastructure, not development

### Scenario B: Organization-Focused

- 30 organizational subscribers
- Average $75/month
- = $2,250/month
- Covers infrastructure + part-time support

### Scenario C: Mixed Model

- 10 organizational subscribers @ $75 = $750
- 3,000 users, 1% donate $5 = $150
- Grants: $500/month (amortized $6k/year)
- = $1,400/month
- Covers infrastructure + minimal development

---

## Financial Transparency

**Commitment:**

- Publish all costs monthly via Open Collective
- Publish funding sources
- Annual financial summary
- No hidden revenue streams

**Rationale:**

- Builds trust with values-aligned users
- Accountability for donations
- Differentiates from opaque corporate platforms

---

## What ditup Will NOT Do

❌ **Sell user data** - Core to value proposition

❌ **Accept venture capital** - Misaligned incentives

❌ **Display advertising** - Engagement over action

❌ **Create paywall for core features** - Two-tier citizenship

❌ **Pursue growth at all costs** - Sustainability over scale

❌ **Accept funding with strings attached** - Editorial/feature independence

---

## Runway Management

### Decision Points

| Runway Remaining | Action                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 6+ months        | Continue development                 |
| 3-6 months       | Intensify grant/revenue efforts      |
| 1-3 months       | Reduce scope, seek emergency funding |
| < 1 month        | Prepare open source handoff          |

### Go/No-Go Criteria

**At 12 months, continue if:**

- 500+ active users
- Some grant or donation revenue
- Evidence of documentation value (retention)
- Path to organizational revenue

**At 12 months, reconsider if:**

- < 100 active users
- No funding secured
- No evidence of individual value
- No organizational interest

---

## Contingency: Graceful Shutdown

If platform cannot sustain:

1. **Announce 6 months in advance** (if possible)
2. **Open source all code** (already open)
3. **Provide data export tools** (already built)
4. **Document for potential future revival**
5. **Help users migrate** to alternatives or self-host

Users retain all data on Solid pods regardless of platform status. This is core benefit of architecture.

---

## Summary

**Most viable path:** Organizational subscriptions from community groups, nonprofits, and local government, supplemented by grants and donations.

**Key insight:** Consumer donations rarely sustain platforms. B2B/B2O (business-to-organization) is more predictable. Target organizations whose mission aligns with civic organizing.

**Critical success factor:** Demonstrating value to organizations early (Phase 2-3) before founder runway exhausted.

**Fallback:** Open source project sustained by volunteer effort if commercial sustainability not achieved.
