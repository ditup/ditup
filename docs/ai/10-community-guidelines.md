# Document 10: Community Guidelines

---

## Purpose

These guidelines exist to maintain ditup as a space for constructive civic engagement. They apply to all public content indexed by the platform.

---

## Core Values

**Constructive Action**
ditup exists to move from problems to solutions to action. Content should contribute to this progression.

**Mutual Respect**
Users may disagree on issues and solutions. Disagreement is welcome. Disrespect is not.

**Local Focus**
ditup is for local issues and community organizing. Keep content relevant to place-based civic engagement.

**Honesty**
Document real issues. Propose genuine ideas. Make commitments you intend to keep.

**Inclusion**
Civic spaces must be accessible to all. Content that excludes people based on identity undermines this.

**Do:**

- Document real issues you observe
- Propose constructive solutions
