# ditup Implementation & Marketing Plan

---

## Principle

**Only advertise what currently works.**

Each phase has matching messaging. Don't promise discovery before users exist. Don't promise collaboration before density exists. Build trust through honest communication about current capabilities.

**Basic profile**

- Name, location (city/region level), bio
- Interest tags (Wikidata-based)
- Profile visibility toggle (hidden until user ready)

## Geographic seeding strategy

### Don't launch everywhere

**Pick 2-3 target areas:**

- Cities where you have personal connections
- Places with active civic/climate/organizing scenes
- Small enough to achieve density, large enough to matter

### Seed manually

- Identify 10-15 potential active users per area
- Personal outreach, not mass marketing
- Help them document first issues
- Facilitate first connections
- Support first actions

### Prove the model

- Document everything that works
- Create case studies from real successes
- Use proven results for expansion marketing

### Expand with evidence

- "This worked in [City A]"
- Specific numbers: "12 people, 3 actions, 1 park cleanup"
- Invite next city with real proof

---

## Budget reality

### Low/no budget tactics (Phase 1-2)

- Personal network outreach
- Solid community engagement
- Content in relevant forums
- Word of mouth

### Medium budget tactics (Phase 3-4)

- Targeted local advertising in seeded areas
- Sponsored content in activist/civic spaces
- Conference presence
- Case study production

### Sustainability (Phase 5)

- Grant funding (civic tech foundations)
- Organizational subscriptions
- Donation model
- Potential premium features

---

## Risk acknowledgment

**Feature risks:**

- Discovery worthless without density
- Actions may not complete at sufficient rate
- Reputation gaming possible in small groups
- Solid requirement limits adoption

**Marketing risks:**

- Overpromising discovery before density exists
- Promising collaboration before actions happen
- Losing credibility through unrealistic claims

**Mitigation:**

- Phase messaging strictly to capabilities
- Be transparent about growth stage
- Use specific numbers, not vague claims
- Admit limitations honestly

---

## Timeline (rough)

| Phase | Duration   | Dependencies      |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1     | 3-4 months | Technical build   |
| 2     | 2-3 months | Phase 1 user base |
| 3     | 3-4 months | Phase 2 density   |
| 4     | 2-3 months | Phase 3 activity  |
| 5     | Ongoing    | Proven model      |

**Total to basic reputation system:** ~12-15 months

This assumes focused execution and successful community seeding. Delays likely if density targets not met.
