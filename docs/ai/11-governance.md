# Document 11: Governance Model

---

## Current Stage: Founder-Led

ditup is currently in early development, led by a single founder. This document outlines current governance and plans for evolution.

---

## Current Governance (Phase 1-2)

### Decision Authority

| Decision Type          | Authority | Input               |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Product direction      | Founder   | User feedback       |
| Feature prioritization | Founder   | Community needs     |
| Community guidelines   | Founder   | Community input     |
| Moderation             | Founder   | Clear process       |
| Partnerships           | Founder   | Partner needs       |
| Technical architecture | Founder   | Technical community |

### Transparency

**Public:**

- Product roadmap
- Community guidelines
- Moderation process (not individual decisions)
- Funding sources and costs

**Founder commitments:**

- Respond to community feedback
- Explain major decisions
- Acknowledge mistakes
- Maintain open source code

---

## Governance Evolution

### Trigger for Evolution

Move to more distributed governance when:

- 500+ active users
- 3+ community moderators
- Sustainable funding secured
- Community clearly wants voice

### Principles for Governance Evolution

1. **Progressive decentralization** - Add community input gradually
2. **Subsidiarity** - Decisions at lowest appropriate level
3. **Representation** - Diverse voices included
4. **Sustainability** - Governance that works with limited resources
5. **Pragmatism** - Functional over ideological purity

---

## Phase 3-4: Community Council

### Structure

**Community Council:**

- 5-7 members
- Mix of elected and appointed
- Rotating terms (1-2 years)
- Founder remains as one member

**Council Composition:**

- 2 seats: Founder + core team
- 3-5 seats: Community-elected
- Consider: Geographic diversity, partner organizations, active contributors

### Council Responsibilities

| Area                 | Council Role               | Founder Role           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Community guidelines | Approve changes            | Propose, implement     |
| Major features       | Input and consent          | Design, build          |
| Moderation appeals   | Final decision             | First-level moderation |
| Partnerships         | Approve major partnerships | Negotiate, manage      |
| Budget priorities    | Input                      | Control                |
| Technical direction  | Informed                   | Decides                |

### Election Process

**Eligibility to vote:**

- Active user for 3+ months
- Verified attendance at 2+ actions OR
- Documented 5+ issues OR
- Active community contributor

**Eligibility to run:**

- Active user for 6+ months
- Good standing (no major moderation actions)
- Commitment to serve term

**Election mechanics:**

- Annual election
- Ranked-choice voting
- 2-week nomination period
- 2-week voting period
- Results public

### Council Operations

**Meetings:**

- Monthly video call (public summary)
- Async discussion for ongoing matters
- Quarterly public community call

**Decision-making:**

- Consensus preferred
- Vote if consensus not reached
- Majority wins, minority view recorded
- Founder has veto on existential/safety issues (documented)

---

## Phase 5+: Cooperative or Foundation

### Options for Long-Term Governance

**Option A: Platform Cooperative**

- Users are member-owners
- Democratic control
- One member, one vote
- Surplus shared or reinvested

**Option B: Nonprofit Foundation**

- Mission-locked
- Board-governed
- No ownership shares
- Tax-advantaged in some jurisdictions

**Option C: Federated Governance**

- Multiple independent instances
- Shared protocol/standards
- Local governance per instance
- Coordination body for shared concerns

**Assessment:**

| Model       | Pros                                | Cons                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Cooperative | Democratic, aligned incentives      | Complex to set up, jurisdiction issues |
| Foundation  | Clear structure, mission protection | Board can become disconnected          |
| Federation  | Scalable, local autonomy            | Coordination challenges, fragmentation |

**Likely path:** Start with foundation structure, enable federation over time. Cooperative possible if community strongly wants it.

## Decision-Making Framework

### Decision Categories

**Type 1: Reversible, low impact**

- Examples: UI changes, minor features, content moderation
- Authority: Founder/team
- Process: Just do it, communicate after

**Type 2: Reversible, medium impact**

- Examples: New feature launches, policy tweaks, partnerships
- Authority: Founder with input
- Process: Propose, gather feedback, decide, communicate

**Type 3: Irreversible or high impact**

- Examples: Major pivots, governance changes, shutdowns
- Authority: Council (when exists) or community
- Process: Proposal, discussion period, formal decision, implementation

### RFC Process (When Council Exists)

**For significant changes:**

1. **Proposal (RFC)** - Written proposal with rationale
2. **Discussion period** - 2 weeks community input
3. **Revision** - Incorporate feedback
4. **Council vote** - If consensus not reached
5. **Implementation** - With timeline
6. **Review** - After implementation
