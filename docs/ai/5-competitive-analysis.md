# Document 5: Competitive Analysis

---

## Overview

This analysis examines platforms that overlap with ditup's core functions: local issue documentation, community discovery, civic organizing, and action coordination.

None fully occupy ditup's intended space, but each addresses parts of it. The question is whether ditup's combination of features justifies switching costs.

## Direct Competitors

### Nextdoor

**What it is:** Hyperlocal social network for neighborhoods

**Users:** 75+ million (US-focused, expanding)

**Business model:** Advertising, local business promotion

**What it does well:**

- Geographic verification (address-based)
- High adoption in many areas
- Local discussion threads
- Lost pet / recommendations features popular

**What it does poorly:**

- Optimizes for engagement, not action
- Known for complaint culture, sometimes racist posts
- Heavy moderation burden
- No issue → action flow
- No reputation for showing up
- Data owned by Nextdoor Inc.
- Advertising-driven incentives misalign with user goals

**ditup differentiation:**

- Action completion focus vs discussion
- Attendance tracking
- Data ownership via Solid
- No advertising incentives
- Structured issue/idea format vs freeform posts

**User switching cost:** High. Nextdoor has density. Friends/neighbors already there.

**Honest assessment:** Nextdoor's density advantage is significant. ditup won't compete on general local discussion. Must win on action-oriented organizing where Nextdoor fails.

---

### Meetup

**What it is:** Event discovery and group coordination

**Users:** 50+ million members

**Business model:** Subscription for organizers, free for attendees

**What it does well:**

- Event creation and RSVP
- Calendar integration
- High intent users (seeking in-person activity)
- Good for recurring events
- Geographic and interest-based discovery

**What it does poorly:**

- Event-driven, not issue-driven
- No problem documentation
- No progression from issue → solution → action
- Attendance tracking unreliable (RSVPs don't match reality)
- Organizer-centric (attendees are passive)
- No reputation system
- Paywalled for organizers

**ditup differentiation:**

- Issue-first rather than event-first
- Verification of who actually shows up
- Reputation building for participants, not just organizers
- Free for all users
- Ideas and documentation layer

**User switching cost:** Medium. Meetup organizers invested in platform. Attendees switch easily.

**Honest assessment:** Meetup is strong for recurring social/hobby events. ditup's angle is issue-driven action with accountability. Different use case with some overlap.

---

### Facebook Groups

**What it is:** Group discussion within Facebook ecosystem

**Users:** Billions (within Facebook)

**Business model:** Advertising (parent platform)

**What it does well:**

- Ubiquitous - everyone has account
- Rich feature set (events, posts, photos, comments)
- Network effects (easy to invite people)
- Group discovery
- Strong notification system

**What it does poorly:**

- Optimizes for engagement, not action
- Algorithmic feed hides content
- Data owned by Meta
- Groups often become discussion-only
- No structured issue/idea format
- No attendance tracking
- Privacy concerns
- Platform can change rules arbitrarily

**ditup differentiation:**

- Data ownership
- No algorithmic manipulation
- Structured issue → action flow
- Attendance verification
- Can't be bought/shut down

**User switching cost:** Very high. Everyone is on Facebook. Leaving means losing network.

**Honest assessment:** Facebook Groups is the default for local organizing by inertia. ditup cannot compete on network size. Must offer enough functional advantage that organizers choose to add ditup for specific purposes, possibly while maintaining Facebook presence.

### FixMyStreet

**What it is:** UK-based platform for reporting local issues to councils

**Users:** Millions of reports (UK-focused)

**Business model:** Nonprofit, council contracts

**What it does well:**

- Simple issue reporting with photo/location
- Routes directly to local government
- Tracks issue status
- Public accountability for council responses
- Clear, focused purpose

**What it does poorly:**

- Government-oriented (no peer collaboration)
- No community discovery
- No action coordination between citizens
- No ideas/solutions layer
- UK-focused
- No reputation system
- Doesn't build community, just reports

**ditup differentiation:**

- Peer-to-peer, not citizen-to-government
- Community discovery and collaboration
- Ideas and action proposals
- Reputation system
- Not dependent on government response

**User switching cost:** Low. Complementary rather than competing. User could use both.

**Honest assessment:** FixMyStreet solves reporting to government. ditup solves organizing with peers. Could coexist. Different problem sets.

### Hylo

**What it is:** Platform for purpose-driven communities

**Users:** Small (thousands, niche)

**Business model:** Cooperative, some consulting revenue

**What it does well:**

- Post types (discussion, request, offer, resource, project, event)
- Map view
- Skills/interests on profiles
- Open source
- Cooperative governance
- Group nesting

**What it does poorly:**

- Requires joining specific groups (discovery friction)
- Still discussion-heavy
- No attendance tracking
- No reputation based on showing up
- Small user base, limited density
- Groups can become ghost towns
- No public issue documentation layer

**ditup differentiation:**

- No groups to join - emergent community from interests + location
- Attendance verification
- Reputation for showing up
- Public issue documentation as entry point

**User switching cost:** Low. Hylo is niche. Similar values-aligned audience.

**Honest assessment:** Hylo is closest competitor in values and approach. ditup's attendance tracking and ungrouped discovery model are key differentiators. May share target audience.

### SeeClickFix

**What it is:** Citizen reporting platform for local issues

**Users:** Millions of reports (US-focused)

**Business model:** Government/municipal contracts

**What it does well:**

## Positioning Gaps

### What no competitor does well:

1. **Issue → Idea → Action flow** - Complete progression from documenting problem to proposing solution to coordinating action

2. **Attendance verification** - No platform verifies who actually shows up to events/actions

3. **Reputation from showing up** - No platform builds portable reputation based on verified participation

4. **Private-first civic documentation** - No platform offers private issue/idea notes with optional publishing

5. **Data ownership** - No mainstream competitor offers user-controlled data via Solid or similar

6. **Ungrouped discovery** - Most platforms require joining groups. Discovery based on location + interests without group membership is rare.

### Where ditup is weakest:

1. **Network density** - All competitors with adoption have density advantage

2. **Habit formation** - Users already check Facebook, Nextdoor daily. No habit for ditup.

3. **Government integration** - FixMyStreet/SeeClickFix have direct municipal connections

4. **General-purpose utility** - Facebook/Discord serve many purposes. ditup is single-purpose.

## Strategic Implications

### Don't compete on:

- General local discussion (Nextdoor wins)
- Recurring social events (Meetup wins)
- Government issue reporting (FixMyStreet/SeeClickFix win)
- Real-time chat (Discord wins)
- Network size (Facebook wins)

### Compete on:

- Issue → Action completion rate
- Attendance accountability
- Portable reputation
- Data ownership
- Structured civic documentation
- Discovery without joining groups

### Potential coexistence strategies:

- Users keep Nextdoor for general local chat, use ditup for action organizing
- Users keep Meetup for recurring events, use ditup for issue-driven actions
- Users keep Facebook for broad network, use ditup for civic documentation

### Potential partnership angles:

- Hylo: Similar values, possible integration or data sharing
- FixMyStreet: Complementary (government vs peer), could link
- Transition Towns: Existing community that could adopt ditup

---

## Honest Competitive Assessment

**Biggest threat:** Users satisfied enough with Facebook Groups + Meetup combination. Not perfect, but works well enough. Switching cost is high.

**Biggest opportunity:** Action completion gap. All discussion platforms fail at turning talk into action. If ditup demonstrably improves action completion rates, it has genuine value proposition.

**Critical uncertainty:** Is "better action completion" compelling enough to overcome network effects of established platforms? Unknown until tested.
