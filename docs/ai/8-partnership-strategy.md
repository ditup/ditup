# Document 8: Partnership Strategy

---

## Purpose

Partnerships address ditup's core weakness: lack of network density at launch. Instead of acquiring individual users, partner with existing organized communities who can adopt collectively.

---

## Partnership Principles

1. **Value alignment** - Partners share civic/collaborative values
2. **Mutual benefit** - Clear value for both parties
3. **No exploitation** - Don't extract from communities
4. **Autonomy** - Partners control their use of platform
5. **Honest about limitations** - Don't oversell current capabilities

---

## Partnership Tiers

### Tier 1: Community Adoption Partners

**Description:** Existing organized communities that adopt ditup as coordination tool

**Value to partner:**

- Better action coordination than current tools
- Attendance tracking
- Member engagement visibility
- Data ownership (not locked into corporate platform)

**Value to ditup:**

- Instant network density in geographic area
- Real usage data and feedback
- Case studies and testimonials
- Word-of-mouth within movement

**Ideal partners:**

| Organization Type        | Why Good Fit                                  | Potential Friction                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Transition Towns         | Values-aligned, local action focus, networked | May have existing tools                    |
| Climate action groups    | Action-oriented, motivated                    | Urgency may not tolerate new tool friction |
| Community gardens        | Local, collaborative, visible results         | May be low-tech                            |
| Cycling advocacy         | Issue-focused, documentable problems          | May prefer specialized tools               |
| Mutual aid networks      | Peer-to-peer, trust-based                     | Privacy concerns                           |
| Housing associations     | Geographic density, shared issues             | Formal structures may resist               |
| Makerspaces/hackerspaces | Tech-comfortable, project-oriented            | May build own tools                        |

**Engagement approach:**

1. Identify specific local chapter/group (not national org)
2. Find existing contact or warm introduction
3. Understand their current tools and pain points
4. Offer pilot with direct support
5. Iterate based on their feedback
6. Document success for other groups

**Commitment required from partner:**

- 10+ members willing to try platform
- 3-month pilot commitment
- Feedback sessions
- Permission to use as case study (if successful)

**Commitment from ditup:**

- Direct onboarding support
- Rapid bug fixes for their use case
- Feature prioritization input
- Free forever (not bait-and-switch)

---

## Priority Partners (Phase 1-2)

### Target 1: Transition Towns Network

**Why:**

- Values-aligned (local resilience, community action)
- Already organized into local groups
- Issue-focused (energy, food, transport)
- Networked internationally but locally active
- Open to new tools

**Approach:**

1. Connect with local Transition group near you
2. Offer personal onboarding
3. Document their issues/actions
4. Iterate on their feedback
5. If successful, connect with Transition Network hub
6. Offer to other Transition groups

**Risk:** May be satisfied with current tools (Facebook groups, email lists)

---

### Target 2: Solid Community

**Why:**

- Already have Solid pods
- Understand data ownership value
- Technical, can tolerate early-stage product
- Motivated to see Solid succeed
- Small but accessible community

**Approach:**

1. Engage in Solid forums/chat
2. Present ditup as Solid use case
3. Invite early testing
4. Incorporate feedback on Solid integration
5. Present at Solid World or similar events

**Risk:** Small community, may not be target civic users

---

### Target 3: Local Climate Action Group

**Why:**

- Issue-focused (documentable problems)
- Action-oriented (not just discussion)
- Motivated by urgency
- Often frustrated with existing tools
- Local focus

**Approach:**

1. Identify specific local group (not national org)
2. Attend their meetings/events
3. Understand their organizing challenges
4. Offer ditup as pilot for specific campaign
5. Support their first actions on platform

**Risk:** May need faster/more reliable tool than early-stage ditup

---

## Partnership Outreach Process

### Step 1: Research (Before Contact)

- Understand their current tools
- Identify their pain points (from public sources)
- Find the right person to contact
- Check for warm introduction paths

### Step 2: Initial Contact

**Template:**

```
Subject: [Specific reference to their work] + civic organizing tool

Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific thing they did/said]. I'm building ditup, a tool for documenting local issues and coordinating action, with data ownership via Solid.

I'm looking for early community partners to shape the tool. Would [their organization] be interested in a pilot?

What it offers:
- Issue/idea documentation with location
- Action coordination with attendance tracking
- No corporate data ownership
- Free, open source

What I'm asking:
- 10+ members to try it for 3 months
- Regular feedback
- Permission to share results (if positive)

Happy to demo or chat. No pressure.

[Name]
```

### Step 3: Discovery Conversation

**Questions to ask:**

- How do you currently coordinate actions?
- What works well? What's frustrating?
- What would make organizing easier?
- What tools have you tried that didn't work?
- What would a successful pilot look like?

**Questions to answer:**

- What ditup does and doesn't do
- Current stage (honest about limitations)
- What we'd need from them
- What they'd get

### Step 4: Pilot Setup

- Onboard 10+ members with hands-on support
- Create their first issues/actions together
- Weekly check-ins for first month
- Feature prioritization based on their needs
- Document everything for case study

### Step 5: Evaluation

**Success criteria:**

- Members returning to platform
- Actions completed
- Positive feedback
- Willingness to continue/recommend

**If successful:**

- Create case study
- Ask for testimonial
- Ask for introductions to similar groups
- Continue supporting their use

**If unsuccessful:**

- Apply learnings
- Don't burn bridge

## Partnership Anti-Patterns

**Don't do:**

❌ **Approach national organizations first** - Start local, specific
❌ **Promise features that don't exist** - Honest about current state
❌ **Treat partners as users to acquire** - Genuine collaboration
❌ **Abandon partners after launch** - Ongoing relationship
❌ **Extract without giving** - Mutual benefit
❌ **Scale partnerships before proving model** - One at a time initially
