## About

**ditup** is an open-source initiative building a decentralized social network where you:

- Find like-minded folks
- Share ideas and issues
- Build projects together
- Own your data

This is the main monorepo containing the core [applications](./apps/), [packages (TODO)](.), and [documentation](./docs/).

## Technology Stack

Building on top of Universal Social Network - a decentralized network independent of companies, platforms and apps, where members own their identity and data.

- [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org/) is used for decentralized online identity and data storage.
- [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) is used for communication between decentralized actors.
